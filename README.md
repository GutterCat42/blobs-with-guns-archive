# The Blobs with Guns Archive

The no longer maintained source code for my second game, Blobs with Guns, made in Godot 3.

Yes it is disgusting. It's up here for purely archival purposes and is not intended to be actively developed. Besides, nobody can actually read my code anyway ;)

Note that the Builds folder is not included here because it was too big for github, however I did make three releases.

A separate remake of the game may be coming soon. This would be re-developed from the ground up here on github.
